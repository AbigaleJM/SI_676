    "Using the Python tools we have discussed in class (ie, os.path, os, shutil, and specifically os.walk, hashlib, and csv module), create a file inventory. Your inventory should be of the networked labs `data` folder. Your inventory should include the path to each file, the file name, file extension, file size, last modified time, file integrity information (at least one hash digest). Think of this as a sort of deposit list or transfer list that would be necessary to share with someone else as a representation of a digital collection. You have to know the things that are expected in the collection (your list), you have to know what the things are (your metadata), and how they relate to each other (in practice you would want to have more metadata, like unique identifiers, etc, but the paths give an idea of how things are related and would be a solid start). \n",

    "the python script you write (preferably uploaded to a repository on your personal github site, but may be submitted as a file);\n",
    "an inventory in CSV (if sharing a repo, share link to repo). There is some room for variation in the column names, but the elements noted above should give you a pretty clear structure; \n",
    "an accompanying README document that explains the files, their source (provenance), and the metadata fields in the CSV (what they mean, what the datatypes are, where the data comes from or how it was derived), when and how the information was created. Guide for creating README style documents are online, I recommend this one from Cornell Research Data Service, https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme"
